## üõ† Development Notes

- Always return **clean TS/ESLint builds** ‚Äî no warnings or errors.  
- Inline animated logo is **never replaced**, only reused.  
- Performance budget: minimize bundle size, lazy-load non-critical assets.  
- Test fallback paths: if AudioWorklet unavailable, ensure AnalyserNode drives visuals/meters.  
- Accessibility and responsiveness are mandatory.  

---

## üß™ Testing

- Unit tests for feature flag provider, login modal accessibility, and sticky header.  
- Exploratory testing for:  
  - AI features (`ai_feed`, `epk_export`)  
  - Audio visualization performance (WebGL + AnalyserNode fallback)  
- Manual accessibility audits (keyboard navigation, reduced motion).  

---

## üì¶ Deployment

- Built for Vercel / Netlify static hosting.  
- GitHub Actions can be added for CI/CD (lint + build).
